Suggestions to make the program more cohisive:

1. We can scrap all of the information from a product and write the program in a way that all of the product characterists are saved in a tabular format (using Pandas for example)
2. We can automate the program to do a for loop over a list of products and open their webpages and scrap information one by one.
3.The program must save the product data in a pandas or excel file and the use the file to load the page
this is beacuse it take several minutes to scrap an amazon page
4. Program must be designed to scrap the amazon pages once per day.

5. When it takes several seconds to scrap a data from amazon you can load a data using 
a seperate class method with a @cached_property decorator on top of it.
